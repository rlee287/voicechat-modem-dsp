Specification of the Configuration File (Version 0.1)
=====================================================

The configuration file is written using the `StrictYaml <https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/>`_ subset of YAML.

The configuration file first specifies the config file version (``version``),
the sampling rate (``fs``), and the error correction code to use.
After this, the config file specifies the modulation modes
along with their parameters under the ``modulators`` key.

Error Correction Codes
----------------------

The Error Correction Code (ECC) is set with the ``ecc`` key.
Supported Error Correction Codes:

- None (``none`` or ``raw``)
- Hamming (7,4) (``hamming_7_4``)

Modulation Modes
----------------

Modulation modes are set by the ``modulators`` key, underneath which
is a list of modulators, starting with the ``mode`` key that specifies
the modulation mode and followed by mode specific parameters.
The value of the ``mode`` key must be a supported modulation mode.

Supported modulation modes are

- Amplitude Shift Keying (``ask``)
- Frequency Shift Keying (``fsk``)

Modes that will be supported in the future are

- Phase Shift Keying (``psk``)
- Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (``qam``)

Amplitude Shift Keying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters for the ``ask`` mode are as follows:

- ``baud:`` The symbol rate
- ``carrier:`` The carrier frequency
- ``amplitudes:`` A list of amplitudes between 0 and 1

Phase Shift Keying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters for the ``psk`` mode are as follows:

- ``baud:`` The symbol rate
- ``carrier:`` The carrier frequency
- ``phases:`` A list of phases between 0 and 1 (internally multiplied by 2Ï€)

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters for the ``qam`` mode are as follows:

- ``baud:`` The symbol rate
- ``carrier:`` The carrier frequency
- ``constellation:`` A list of constellation points, specified either as
  ``{re}+{im}i`` or as ``({amp}, {phase})``

.. note::
    When specifying points in Cartesian form, the imaginary component
    must *always* be included as a number followed by the literal "i".

Frequency Shift Keying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters for the ``fsk`` mode are as follows:

- ``baud:`` The symbol rate
- ``amplitude:`` The amplitude of the signal
- ``frequencies:`` A list of frequencies between 0 and the Nyquist limit
